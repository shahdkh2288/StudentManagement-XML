# Student-Management-XML

This project implements a Student Management System using XML to store student data. The system allows for adding student information, storing it in an XML file, searching by GPA or First Name, and deleting specific records.

## Features:
1. **Add Student Data**: The program prompts the user to enter the student details (ID, First Name, Last Name, Gender, GPA, Level, Address) and stores them in an XML file.
2. **Search Functionality**: Users can search for a student by GPA or First Name. The program retrieves the matching student data from the XML file.
3. **Delete Record**: Users can choose a specific student record to delete from the XML file.

## Technologies:
- Java
- XML for data storage

## Note:
The program will create and maintain an `students.xml` file in the project directory, which stores the student information in XML format.
